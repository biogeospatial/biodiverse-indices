    "text": "Overview\nThis is a listing of the indices available in Biodiverse, ordered by the calculations used to generate them. It is generated from the system metadata and contains all the information visible in the GUI, plus some additional details.\nMost of the headings are self-explanatory. For the others:\n\nThe Subroutine is the name of the subroutine used to call the function if you are using Biodiverse through a script.\nThe Index is the name of the index in the SPATIAL_RESULTS list, or if it is its own list then this will be its name. These lists can contain a variety of values, but are usually lists of labels with some value, for example the weights used in an endemism calculation. The names of such lists typically end in “LIST”, “ARRAY”, “HASH”, “LABELS” or “STATS”.\nGrouping? states whether or not the index can be used to define the grouping for a cluster or region grower analysis. A blank value means it cannot be used for either.\nThe Minimum number of neighbour sets dictates whether or not a calculation or index will be run. If you specify only one neighbour set then all those calculations that require two sets will be dropped from the analysis. (This is always the case for calculations applied to cluster nodes as there is only one neighbour set, defined by the set of groups linked to the terminal nodes below a cluster node). Note that many of the calculations lump neighbour sets 1 and 2 together. See the SpatialConditions page for more details on neighbour sets.\n\nNote that some calculations can provide different numbers of indices depending on the nature of the BaseData set used. This currently applies to the hierarchically partitioned endemism calculations (both central and whole).\nFor space reasons, columns are not shown if all cells are empty.",
